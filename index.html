        <p>Hi.</p>
        <p>Im darkloyd.</p>
        <p>im learning JavaScript, so I made this simple game to test my skills.</p>
        <p>Why do I want to learn this "Complicated" crap?</p>
        <p>Because I want to make awesome things and get a good paying job when I'm older. That's why. It's also very fun.</p>
        <p>Anyways... it would be awesome if you could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClM2-mauMh_qF36XmU3qJoQ">Subscribe</a>, because it's my dream to become at least a "Slightly" popular YouTuber!</p>
        <p>All coding by me UNLESS you count the slight bug fixing Chat GPT helped me out with SLIGHTLY... Btw it REALLY knows EVERYTHING I swear.</p>
        <p>All of this code was made on a school ChromeBook using the "Text" (not texting) application, which I was surprised to see had formatting features for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>I taught this to myself using W3 Schools. They REALLY broke it down for me. It makes JavaScript look about 1K times less complicated for me, BUT I am still learning so support me however you can, if you want to...</p>
        <p>Also if you use an auto clicker here it can REALLY get out of hand! XD</p>
        <p>And yes, school computers can have autoclickers in bookmarks if you have GitHub unblocked.</p>
